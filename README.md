Reminder:
manjaro bad :rage:

To get started,

- It's a clusterfuck full of security issues, broken packages among other shit
- They delay packages which breaks a lot of shit
- Their own updater had a security vulnerability which was fixed recently [1]
- When the ssl certs of manjaro's website expired, the devs asked the users to change the date and visit [2]
- If you just want a GUI installer for Arch, then use Acro Linux, Antergos. They are much better and don't do
  retarded things like Manjaro. If you're comfortable with a TUI installer, then use Anarchy.
