Reminder:
manjaro bad :rage:

To get started,

- It's a clusterfuck full of security issues, broken packages among other shit
- They delay packages which breaks a lot of shit, the AUR seems to not be delayed and therefore isn't in-sync with the main packages. So the main reason most of manjaro users are using Manjaro might break unnecessarily, because the AUR(ARCH user repository) is expecting package versions from the ARCH repositories.
- Their own updater had a security vulnerability which was fixed recently [1]
- When the ssl certs of manjaro's website expired, the devs asked the users to change the date and visit [2]
- If you just want a GUI installer for Arch, then use Acro Linux, Antergos. They are much better and don't do
  retarded things like Manjaro. If you're comfortable with a TUI installer, then use Anarchy.
- Installing Arch is easy. If you're here, it means you can read. And if you can read, the Arch wiki is just a click away. If you think reading the Arch wiki is hard, you don't want to be using an Arch derivative anyways. Understand what's going on, instead of being a help vampire on a random forum. Arch users aren't being elitist, they're expecting you to do the minimum research you skipped out on by installing it a different way.
- Arch is more stable than you think. The main reason being that you've built your own system. You know what's on it. You know how it works. If something breaks, which is unlikely you'll be able to fix it. If it's gonna break on Manjaro, what are you going to do? You have no idea how your system works, and will find it very difficult to fix. Delaying packages for 2 weeks on its own doesn't really do much for stability.
- Alternatives, that are easy to install aren't that bad. Ubuntu and Debian get a bad rep in the hobbyistcommunities for no reason. Although they have issues, they're very good distributions. And guess what, they're easy to install too, and will teach you a lot. OpenSUSE is another one of these, easy to install, easy to use distros. Learn Linux by using Linux, not by installing some arbitrary distribution like that's gonna teach you anything useful.
